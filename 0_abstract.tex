Security is yet another important concern amongst several in modern computer
systems. These concerns often exist in contention over a set of finite
resources, e.g. DRAM bandwidth/capacity, CPU time, drive space, etc., creating a
space of possible tradeoffs between concerns that allow us to optimize against
some constraint. My current research focuses on exploring these disparate
tradeoff spaces, specifically where compromises between service-level security
guarantees, system energy budget, and overall system performance might be made
in the interest of high-performance or low-energy configurations. My interests
also include more interdisciplinary topics, including operating systems, file
systems, control theory, and computer security more broadly, i.e.
distributed/embedded/IoT systems and related protocols.

Full-drive encryption (FDE) is especially important for mobile devices because
they contain large quantities of sensitive data yet are easily lost or stolen.
Unfortunately, the standard approach to FDE---the AES block cipher in XTS
mode---is 3--5x slower than unencrypted storage. Authenticated encryption based
on stream ciphers is already used as a faster alternative to AES in other
contexts, such as HTTPS, but the conventional wisdom is that stream ciphers are
unsuitable for FDE. Used naively in drive encryption, stream ciphers are
vulnerable to attacks, and mitigating these attacks with on-drive metadata is
generally believed to ruin performance. In this paper, we argue that recent
developments in mobile hardware invalidate this assumption, making it possible
to use fast stream ciphers for FDE. Modern mobile devices employ solid-state
storage with Flash Translation Layers (FTL), which operate similarly to
Log-structured File Systems (LFS). They also include trusted hardware such as
Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) and secure storage areas. Leveraging these
two trends, we propose StrongBox, a stream cipher-based FDE layer that is a
drop-in replacement for dm-crypt, the standard Linux FDE module based on
AES-XTS. StrongBox introduces a system design and on-drive data structures that
exploit LFS's lack of overwrites to avoid costly rekeying and a counter stored
in trusted hardware to protect against attacks. We implement StrongBox on an ARM
big.LITTLE mobile processor and test its performance under multiple popular
production LFSes. We find that StrongBox improves read performance by as much as
2.36x (1.72x on average) while offering stronger integrity guarantees.
