\section{Project Timeline}

These are dates we expect certain research milestones to be accomplished:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{4/2019} Use case studies
    \item \textbf{5/2019} Literature review on FDE theory and formal organization
    \item \textbf{5-6/2019} StrongBox II cipher switching draft paper is completed
    \item \textbf{6/2019} Formal theoretical framework to model StrongBox
    security guarantees
    \item \textbf{12/2019} Analysis of security model and guarantees versus
    AES-XTS and other schemes
    \item \textbf{2/2020} StrongBox III (theoretical security framework) draft
    paper is completed
\end{enumerate}

\section{StrongBox I: Confidentiality, Integrity, and Performance using Stream Ciphers}

(todo)

\subsection{Completed Work}

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textit{StrongBox: Confidentiality, Integrity, and Performance using
    Stream Ciphers for Full Drive Encryption} was published in the Proceedings
    of the Twenty-Third International Conference on Architectural Support for
    Programming Languages and Operating Systems (ASPLOS'18).

    \item The full source for StrongBox I is available open source (see
    \appref{availability}).

    \item The StrongBox approach has been patented by the University of Chicago,
    pending prosecution and non-provisional filing.

    \item Using stream ciphers for Full Disk/Drive Encryption motivated research
    in a similar vein: using stream ciphers with highly available systems to
    secure arbitrary resources on the internet (see \secref{inspired}).
\end{itemize}

\section{StrongBox II: Energy, Security, and Performance Tradeoffs with Cipher Switching}

(todo)

\subsection{Alternative Considerations}

(todo; lack of suitable energy tradeoffs)

\section{StrongBox III: Theoretical Framework for Analyzing StrongBox Security Properties}

(todo)

\subsection{Current Goals}

(todo)

\subsection{Alternative Considerations}

(todo; loose threat coverage (oh noes!), no valid attack comparison between
strongbox with chacha and AES)
